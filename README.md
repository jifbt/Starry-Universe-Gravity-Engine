Starry Universe Gravity Engine, a space engine made with python turtle.
- Earliest Python environment required: every python version since `Python 3.0.0`.
- Earliest Operating System required: 
  - `Windows`: higher than `Windows 7`.

- Version introduce:
  - 0.0: All the arguments are in the code and it uses a simple main loop to do all the calculation.
  - 0.1: You can configure arguments by a .cfg file called SUGE.cfg. _In 0.1.0 it is called `sus.cfg`._
  - 0.2: We use object-oriented programming instead of the main loop.
  - 0.3: You can use command line arguments now! _For help, type `SUGE_v3_0_x.py --help`._
